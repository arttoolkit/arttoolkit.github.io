  The takeown command is used in Windows to take ownership of files or directories, which can allow a user to access or manipulate files they otherwise wouldnâ€™t have permission to. This is especially useful during post-exploitation when the user has local administrator privileges but lacks access to specific files (e.g. protected documents, loot, or flags).

  Command Reference:
  ```
  Target File: C:\Users\Username\Desktop\flag.txt

  /f: Specifies the file name or directory name pattern. You can use the wildcard character * when specifying the pattern. You can also use the syntax <sharename>\<filename>.
  ```
command: |
  takeown /f "C:\Users\Username\Desktop\flag.txt"

code: |
  icacls "C:\Users\Username\Desktop\flag.txt" /grant Administrators:F
